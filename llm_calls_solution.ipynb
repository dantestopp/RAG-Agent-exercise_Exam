       "'Okay, I can help you with that! A leap year occurs every four years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the rules:\\n\\n1.

This is the primary condition for a leap year.\\n2.  `year % 100 != 0`: This is the *exception*. If a year *is* divisible by 100 (like 1900), it\\'s *not* a leap year unless it meets the next condition.\\n    So, `(year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)` covers years like 2024, 2008, which are divisible by 4 but not by 100.\\n3.  `year % 400 == 0`: This is the *exception to the exception*. If a year *is* divisible by 100, it\\'s still a leap year if it\\'s also divisible by 400 (like 2000).\\n\\nThe `||` (OR) operator combines these: a year is a leap year if it satisfies the first set of conditions (divisible by 4 but not 100) OR if it satisfies the second condition (divisible by 400).'"

      "\n",
      "To cook lamb 'Sous le Sable', we begin by seasoning the lamb shoulder or leg with a blend of herbs and spices, carefully selected to complement the rich flavor of the lamb. Then, we wrap it in a layer of fat, typically from the same animal, to keep it moist and add an extra layer of flavor. Next, we place the lamb in a pit, covering it with a layer of sand, and on top of that, we build a fire. The heat from the fire cooks the lamb slowly, over several hours, as the sand acts as a natural insulator, distributing the heat evenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result, my friend, is a lamb that's tender, juicy, and infused with a subtle, smoky flavor. The texture is simply sublime, with the connective tissues breaking down to create a rich, unctuous sauce that coats the palate. It's a truly primal, elemental way of cooking, and one that I adore. (smiling) And, of course, the presentation is always dramatic, as we unearth the lamb from its sandy cocoon, revealing a dish that's as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Isn't that just a primitive, rustic method?\" Ah, but that's the beauty of it! 'Sous le Sable' is a technique that requires finesse, patience, and a deep understanding of the ingredients and the cooking process. It's a true test of a chef's skill and creativity. (smiling) And, trust me, the results are well worth the effort.\"\n"
